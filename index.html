<!--I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Usability Testing courser at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you will make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy.

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in the the Title of this HTML document below.-->

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we will need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: keep your file names simple and don't use spaces.). Add to/change the other relevant information in the hero image class below.-->

Add the photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below.
